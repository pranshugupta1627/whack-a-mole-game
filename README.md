<h1>Whack a Mole</h1>



<h2>How we decided the problem statement?</h2>

First we went on making a literacy writing model using handpose,
then second we made a fun project of creating filters using face api and 
then finally we created a meaningful game with the third problem statement that:

In todays time most of the teenagers, students and adults have a static posture while binging movies, 
studying in the library or working in a corporate office. 
In order to change this static posture so that humans donâ€™t face health, body and posture issues we have developed a game 
where you need to move your face to play and be the top scorer.

<h2>Sounds exciting. It surely is!</h2>
